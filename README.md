# CPU Scheduling

## Overview
This project is C/C++ designed to simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms. It includes features such as process management, scheduling visualization, and performance metrics.

## Features
- **Process Management**: Add, edit, and delete processes with specific attributes.
- **Scheduling Algorithms**: Implement and visualize different CPU scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculate and display metrics like average waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/almkhlafi/CPUScheduling.git
